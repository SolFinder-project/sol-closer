            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">2.1 Extreme Volatility</h3>
            <p>
              Cryptocurrencies, including SOL (Solana), are subject to extreme price volatility. 
              Their value can fluctuate dramatically in very short periods, potentially resulting in 
              significant financial losses.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">2.2 Risk of Total Loss</h3>
            <p>
              You may lose your entire investment. Only invest amounts you can afford to lose completely.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">2.3 No Guarantees or Insurance</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional bank deposits, cryptocurrencies are not insured by any deposit insurance 
              system or guaranteed by any governmental authority.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">2.4 Market Risks</h3>
            <p>
              Cryptocurrency markets are relatively new, unregulated in many jurisdictions, and can be 
              subject to manipulation, fraud, and other market abuses.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">3. Technical and Blockchain Risks</h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">3.1 Irreversibility of Transactions</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Blockchain transactions are irreversible.</strong> Once confirmed, a transaction 
              cannot be canceled, modified, or refunded. Always verify all transaction details carefully 
              before confirming.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">3.2 Loss of Private Keys</h3>
            <p>
              Loss of your private keys or recovery phrase results in permanent and irretrievable loss 
              of your funds. SOLcloser never has access to your private keys and cannot recover lost funds.
            </p>
            <div className="p-4 bg-red-500/10 border border-red-500/30 rounded-lg mt-4">
              <p className="font-bold text-red-400">
                You are solely responsible for securing and backing up your wallet credentials.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">3.3 Smart Contract Vulnerabilities</h3>
            <p>
              Smart contracts may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or security flaws that could result 
              in the loss of funds. While we strive for security, no smart contract can be guaranteed 
              to be 100% secure.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">3.4 Network Risks</h3>
            <p>
              The Solana network may experience:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Congestion leading to failed or delayed transactions</li>
              <li>Network outages or downtime</li>
              <li>Hard forks or protocol changes</li>
              <li>51% attacks or other consensus failures</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">3.5 Hacking and Security Breaches</h3>
            <p>
              Wallets, exchanges, and blockchain services can be targets of hacking, phishing attacks, 
              or other security breaches. Always use strong security practices.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">4. Regulatory and Legal Risks</h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">4.1 Regulatory Uncertainty</h3>
            <p>
              Cryptocurrency regulation is evolving and varies by jurisdiction. New laws or regulations 
              may affect the legality, taxation, or usability of cryptocurrencies.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Future regulatory actions could:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Prohibit or restrict cryptocurrency ownership or trading</li>
              <li>Impose additional taxes or reporting requirements</li>
              <li>Affect the value or utility of cryptocurrencies</li>
              <li>Impact the availability of services like SOLcloser</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">4.2 Tax Obligations</h3>
            <p>
              Cryptocurrency gains may be subject to taxation in your jurisdiction. You are responsible 
              for understanding and complying with all applicable tax laws.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Failure to comply with tax obligations may result in penalties, fines, or legal action.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">4.3 Legal Status Varies</h3>
            <p>
              The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies significantly across countries and may change 
              without notice. Ensure that your use of SOLcloser complies with all applicable laws in 
              your jurisdiction.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">5.1 "As Is" Service</h3>
            <p>
              SOLcloser is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">5.2 Service Availability</h3>
            <p>
              The Service may be interrupted, suspended, or discontinued at any time, with or without notice.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">5.3 Transaction Fees</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to SOLcloser's service fee (20%), Solana network fees apply to all transactions. 
              These fees can vary based on network congestion and are not controlled by SOLcloser.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-neon-purple mt-6 mb-3">5.4 Third-Party Dependencies</h3>
            <p>
              SOLcloser relies on third-party services (RPC providers, hosting platforms, blockchain 
              infrastructure). Issues with these services may affect SOLcloser's functionality.
